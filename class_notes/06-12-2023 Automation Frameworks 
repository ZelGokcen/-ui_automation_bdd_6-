06-12-2023 Automation Frameworks


Framework: Automation Framework is not a single tool or process, but it is a collection of tools and processes working together to support automated testing of any application.

-Automation framework is a set of rules, regulations, and design patterns that we implement to build a project structure
-It is used to increase code reusability, provide easy maintenance, and allows multiple users to work on same project
-It is a constructive blend of various guidelines, coding standards, concepts, processes, practices, project hierarchies, reporting mechanism, test data injections etc. to pillar automation testing
-It includes our folder structures, libraries, dependencies, test results, test data, resources

Different Framework
1. Test-Driven Framework
2. Behavior-Driven Framework
3. Data-Driven Framework
4. Keyword-Driven Framework
5. Hybrid Framework



1. Test-Driven Development Framework
-One of the core concept in this framework is @Test annotation




Go to https://techglobal-training.com/js-exercises/exercise-3
Validate the title is "JS Arrays"
Validate the content is "In this chapter, you will practice JS Arrays"
Validate that there is 10 exercise displayed with the names below
	Exercise 01: Find sum



public class JSArraysPage{

	public JSArraysPage(){
		PageFactory.initElements(Driver.getDriver(), this);
	}

	@FindBy()
	public WebElement jsArraysHeading;

	@FindBy()
	public WebElement jsArrayscontent;

	@FindBy()
	public List<WebElement> jsArraysExercises;
}


public class Base{
	public static JSArraysPage jsArraysPage;
}


public class JSArraysTest extends Base{
	@BeforeMethod
	public void setPage(){
		driver.get("https://techglobal-training.com/js-exercises/js-arrays");

		jsArraysPage = new JSArraysPage();
	}

	@Test(priority=1, description="TC123 Validate JS Arrays Page")
	public void validateJSArrayPage(){
		Assert.assertTrue(jsArraysPage.jsArraysHeading.isDisplayed());
		.
		.
		.
		.
		.
	}
}




Sprint 2 weeks
Start day is Wednesday

Wednesday -> read requirements and understand
Thursday -> start creating test cases in JIRA
Friday -> Get approval for the test cases

Monday/Tuesday/Wednesday -> SHIFT-LEFT testing TDD approach


Monday/Tuesday

Wednesday 10 AM - DEMO - Sprint Review




2. Keyword-Driven Framework
- You don't need to code!


3. Data-Driven Development Framework
4. Hybrid Framework:  that framework uses advantages of different frameworks like DDD + TDD or DDD + BDD

5. Behavior-Driven Development Framework
-One of the core concept in this framework is focusing on user perspective


TRADITIONAL WAY OF CREATING TEST CASES
Go to https://techglobal-training.com/js-exercises/exercise-3
Validate the title is "JS Arrays"
Validate the content is "In this chapter, you will practice JS Arrays"
Validate that there is 10 exercise displayed with the names below


BDD WAY
Given user is on "https://techglobal-training.com/js-exercises/exercise-3"
Then user should see title as "JS Arrays"
And user should 10 exercises

BDD Syntax (Gherkin): Given, When, Then, And, But

Given
And
And
When
And
And
Then
And
And


Given user is on "https://techglobal-training.com/js-exercises/exercise-3"

@Given("user is on {string}")
public void userIsOn(String URL){
	driver.get(URL);
}





CREATING A BDD FRAMEWORK
- I read the requirements and see what would be the best set of tools to utilize for the framework.
- I will see what company is using as technologies and also what their existing QA team is able to create quickly.


-Decide the programming language: Java
-Decide the build tool: Maven
-TDD or BDD?: involvement of the team members, UI(BDD) or backend(TDD)
-Decide automation tools: Selenium etc
-Decide reporting tools and strategies etc
-KICK OFF!





Important packages in TDD framework:
scripts
pages
utils


Important packages in BDD framework:
steps : actual source code
pages : Page Object Model
runners : executors
utils : reusable components

features : all the gherkin steps (Given, When, Then, And)

What are the differences between Test Case, Test Script and Test Scenario?


Scenario: Validate the title and url after search
Given user navigates to "https://www.google.com"
When user search for "Tesla"
Then user should see "Tesla" in the url
And user should see "Tesla" in the title


AUTOMATION IN BDD FRAMEWORK:
1. Create a feature file
	-Every feature MUST start with a Feature
2. Create your Scenario or Scenario Outline
	-Every test MUST start with a Scenario or Scenario Outline
	-Scenario should have meaningful name
3. Write steps which also requires Page Object Model



Cucumber framework does not allow inheritance in steps package!!!
